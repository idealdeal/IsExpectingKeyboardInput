# IsExpectingKeyboardInput
AHK (AutoHotkey) function to validate if the Windows user is in any sort of input field indicated by a blinking caret.

# Purpose
I initially wrote this function so that I can make us of some "client commands" I wrote in AHK and utilize them in various windows, such as Discord, TeamSpeak and browser games. Checkout the **Example.ahk**!

It might not be the «good practise» solution but it works quite well. Check it out, give it a try and if it makes your coding experience easier that's all I can ask for.
